# A/B Test Analysis for Urban Wear

## Overview
This notebook analyzes an A/B test conducted for Urban Wear, a clothing brand launching an eCommerce store. The goal of the test is to determine whether a **blue submit button (control)** or a **green submit button (treatment)** leads to more email sign-ups on the pre-launch page.

## Objectives
- **Design** an A/B test to compare the effectiveness of two button colors.
- **Analyze** the collected data using statistical methods.
- **Interpret** the results to make a data-driven recommendation.

## Workflow
1. **Load Data**: Import and explore the A/B test dataset.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and structure the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize key metrics and check for anomalies.
4. **Statistical Testing**:
   - Perform a **Chi-square test** or **t-test** to assess statistical significance.
   - Check for potential biases or confounding factors.
5. **Results & Interpretation**: Determine whether the green button outperforms the blue button.
6. **Business Recommendation**: Provide a final recommendation to the Urban Wear product team.

## Expected Outcome
A clear decision on which button version to use based on statistical evidence, ensuring that the choice maximizes email sign-ups for the website launch.
